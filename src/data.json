If your convictions are from another state and Arizona, you might be eligible to restore your right to vote but you must follow the rights restoration process in the state where you were convicted of the felony. Scroll to the top and redo this form to see the process for the state where you were convicted. After that, return to this form and complete the Arizona portion. </br></br>If you have a conviction or multiple convictions in other states, but only a single conviction in Arizona, after checking on the status of your out of state convictions, you should answer the Arizona state court questions as if you only have a single felony conviction. </br></br>If your convictions were in a Federal and an Arizona Court you will need to petition an Arizona state court for rights restoration. You may do this either in the county where you were convicted in state court or in the county in which you reside. For instructions and to check your eligibility, go through the questions for Arizona state court, say no to the question about whether you have a single felony conviction.",
